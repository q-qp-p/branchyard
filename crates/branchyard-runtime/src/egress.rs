//! [`Proxy`]: an allowlisting HTTP and HTTPS forward proxy for a harness's
//! egress, which looks inside a connection when its rule asks it to.
//!
//! It speaks the two forms a proxy-aware client sends: `CONNECT host:port`
//! for TLS (and anything else tunnelled), and an absolute URI
//! (`GET http://host/path`) for plain HTTP. Each request's host and port,
//! and its method and path when the proxy sees them, go to the caller's
//! decision; an allowed one is connected to and relayed, a denied one gets
//! `403 Forbidden` with a body saying why. Every decision, either way, goes
//! to the caller's report, once.
//!
//! A `CONNECT` whose verdict says to inspect is not tunnelled blind. The
//! proxy answers it, then terminates the client's TLS with a certificate
//! for the host signed by the [`Authority`] its [`Interceptor`] holds (one
//! the harness is told to trust), reads one HTTP/1.1 request, asks the
//! decision about its method and path, and, allowed, sends it to the origin
//! over TLS of its own, verified against the Mozilla roots and any extra
//! roots, relaying the response until the origin closes. A client that
//! speaks plain HTTP inside such a tunnel is read the same way.
//!
//! What it guarantees:
//!
//! - Nothing is connected to before the decision allows it, and a host
//!   name the decision allows is resolved here, on this host: a name that
//!   resolves to a loopback or unspecified address is refused unless the
//!   decision says the rule names such an address itself.
//! - A plain HTTP request goes to the host its URI names, with that host
//!   in its `Host` header and `Connection: close`, so one connection
//!   cannot carry a request for another host. `Proxy-*` headers are
//!   dropped.
//! - Inside an inspected connection, exactly one request is read and sent,
//!   in origin form, to the `CONNECT` host; a `Host` header naming another
//!   host is refused; the certificate presented names the `CONNECT` host
//!   only, so a client naming another in its TLS server name fails its own
//!   verification; nothing sent after the request is forwarded.
//! - Dropping the proxy stops it accepting; connections already relayed
//!   end when either side closes.
//!
//! What it does not guarantee:
//!
//! - Anything about what flows through a tunnel it was not told to
//!   inspect: a client that names an allowed host in `CONNECT` and another
//!   in its TLS server name (domain fronting) is not detected there.
//! - HTTP/2 or WebSockets inside an inspected connection: ALPN offers
//!   HTTP/1.1 only, and the connection closes after its one response.
//! - Anything about a client that ignores the proxy. Whether such a client
//!   can reach the network is the caller's business: see
//!   [`crate::LocalProvider::spawn_confined`].
